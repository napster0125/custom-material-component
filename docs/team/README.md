# MDC Web team

MDC Web team members write and review code in this repository.
They work with other Material Design Engineers (Android and iOS)
and Designers to write design docs.

The components across Web, Android, iOS, and Flutter are expected to match [spec](https://material.io/design).

Material Design follows a monthly release cycle. Within those releases, MDC Web uses a 2-3 week sprint system to
prioritize feature requests and tech debt. Accepted tasks are prioritized within
[milestones](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/milestones).
