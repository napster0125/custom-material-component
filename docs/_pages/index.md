Material Design Lite lets you add a [Material Design](http://google.com/design/spec) look and feel to your static content websites. It doesn’t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimise for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers and offer an experience that is accessible from the get-go.

## Cross-device by default

Develop with a single underlying system for your site that allows for a unified experience across platforms and device sizes. Mobile precepts are fundamental, but touch, mouse, and keyboard are all ﬁrst-class input methods.

## Built with <abbr title="Block Element Modifier">BEM</abbr> &amp; Sass

Material Design Lite provides vanilla CSS. Our source utilises Sass, the popular CSS preprocessor and BEM - [the front-end naming methodology](https://github.com/google/material-design-lite/wiki/Understanding-BEM). Quickly get started with the pre-built CSS or build the source yourself.

## Components

With Material Design Lite, you get dozens of custom HTML and CSS components. They're documented, lightweight and bring the beauty of Material Design to content sites.
