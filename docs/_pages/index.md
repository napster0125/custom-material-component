Material Design Lite lets you add a [Material Design](http://google.com/design/spec) look and feel to your static content websites. It doesnâ€™t rely on any JavaScript frameworks and aims to optimise for cross-device use, gracefully degrade in older browsers and offer an experience that is accessible from the get-go.
