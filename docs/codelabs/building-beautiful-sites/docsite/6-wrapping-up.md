# Wrapping up

By using some simple markup, ~100 lines of CSS, ~4 lines of JavaScript, and the Material Components for the web library, you have the start of a beautiful e-commerce app that conforms to the Material Design guidelines and looks great across all devices. Your designer is happy, and you get to leave work early.

> A final version of the app is completed for you within the `docs/codelabs/building-beautiful-sites/completed directory`. Feel free to test your version of the site against the app in that directory. Don't forget to run npm install in that directory first!

## Next steps

While this plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript approach is good for this simple example, a production e-commerce site (or any modern web application) will most likely be using a framework. MDC-Web was built from the ground up with framework interoperability in mind, and can seamlessly integrate into all modern web development frameworks. We encourage you to check out the  [framework integration guide](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/blob/master/docs/integrating-into-frameworks.md), look at some [framework integration examples](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/framework-examples), and explore the [rest of Material Components](https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web/tree/master/packages). Thanks so much for trying MDC-Web. We hope you enjoyed this codelab!
