# Set up your development environment

Duration: 5:00
{: .duration}


## Install the project’s dependencies

From the starter directory (it should be your current directory), run `npm install`. You will see a lot of activity and at the end, the output will show a successful install.

## Run the starter app

Run `npm run dev` in the same directory (starter directory) in which you just ran `npm install`. The live-server will start. It watches the directory for source code changes and launches a web browser pointing to the page.

> If you were unable to run `npm install` or `npm run dev` successfully, stop and troubleshoot your developer environment.
{: .warning}

Voilà! Shrine is running in your browser. You can scroll through the page to see a list of product cards.
