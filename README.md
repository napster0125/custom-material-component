# Material Components Web (MDC-Web)

> Project status: **pre-alpha**

## Overview

MDC-Web is the next generation of Material Design components for the Web, incorporating the latest in material design thinking and a flexible component architecture under the hood. It is the successor to [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/).

The project has 3 high-level goals:

- Production-ready components consumable in an a-la-carte fashion
- Best-in-class performance and adherence to the [material design guidelines](https://material.google.com)
- Seamless integration with other JS frameworks and libraries

In order to achieve these goals, we are planning a complete re-architecture of the original MDL component library, alongside new tooling and infrastructure.

Please see our [developer's guide](docs/developer.md) for more in-depth information.
