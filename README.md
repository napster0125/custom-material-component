# Material Components for the web

Material Components for the web (MDC-Web) help developers execute [Material Design](https://www.material.io). 
Developed by a core team of engineers and UX designers at Google, these components enable a reliable development workflow to build beautiful and functional web projects.

Material Components for the web is the successor to [Material Design Lite](https://getmdl.io/), and has 3 high-level goals:

- Production-ready components consumable in an a-la-carte fashion
- Best-in-class performance and adherence to the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.google.com)
- Seamless integration with other JS frameworks and libraries
