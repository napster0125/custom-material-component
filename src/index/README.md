Material Design Lite (MDL) is a library of components for web developers 
based on Google's Material Design Philosophy: "A visual language for our 
users that synthesizes the classic principles of good design with the 
innovation and possibility of technology and science." Understanding the 
goals and principles of Material Design is critical to the proper use of 
the Material Design Lite components. If you have not yet read the 
<a href="http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html">Material Design Introduction</a> 
you should do so before attempting to use the components.
