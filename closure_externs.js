/**
 * @fileoverview This file is where any externs for third party libraries we use should be placed
 * so that closure can type-check them.
 *
 * Closure historically works using "namespaces", e.g.
 *
 * // fileA.js
 * goog.provide('app.a');
 * app.a.return5 = () => 5;
 *
 * // fileB.js
 *
 * goog.provide('app.b');
 * goog.require('app.a');
 * app.b.return10 = () => app.a.return5() * 2;
 *
 * The way that closure reconciles this with path-based module loading systems
 * such as CommonJS and ES2015 is by using the `goog:` prefix to load any modules exported via
 * `goog.provide()` using path-based module loading methods.
 *
 * For example, given this source file:
 *
 * goog.provide('app.util');
 * app.util.someMethod = () => // ...
 *
 * It can be imported using ES2015 in closure via the following:
 *
 * import {someMethod} from 'goog:app.util';
 * // use someMethod
 *
 * Our convention here is as follows:
 *
 * - All third party modules should exported via `goog.provide()` using the namespace
 *   `mdc.thirdparty.<CAMEL_CASE_MODULE_NAME>`. E.g. 'focus-trap' is provided as
 *   `goog.provide('mdc.thirdparty.focusTrap')`.
 * - Any default exports from a module MUST be attached to the namespace as a property
 *   named `default`. This is so our module rewrite script can handle default exports from
 *   third-party modules.
 *
