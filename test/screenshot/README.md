# Screenshot Tests

Prevent visual regressions by running screenshot tests on every PR.

## Quick start

### API credentials

Add the following to your `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.bashrc` file:

```bash
export MDC_CBT_USERNAME='you@example.com'
export MDC_CBT_AUTHKEY='example'
```

Credentials can be found here:

* [CrossBrowserTesting.com > Account](https://crossbrowsertesting.com/account) \
    `Authkey` is listed under the `User Profile` section
* [Google Cloud Console > IAM & admin > Service accounts](https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts?project=material-components-web) \
    Click the `ï¸™` icon on the right side of the service account, then choose `Create key` 

### Test your changes

Modify a Sass file:

```bash
echo '.mdc-button:not(:disabled){color:red}' >> packages/mdc-button/mdc-button.scss
```
 
Run the tests:

```bash
npm run screenshot:test
```

You should see something like this in the terminal:

```
Changed 1 screenshot:
  - mdc-fab/classes/baseline.html > desktop_windows_edge@latest

```

## Basic usage

### Updating "golden" screenshots

On the
[report page](https://storage.googleapis.com/mdc-web-screenshot-tests/advorak/2018/07/14/03_37_19_142/report/report.html),
select the checkboxes for all screenshots you want to approve, and click the "Approve" button at the bottom of the page.

This will display a modal dialog containing a CLI command to copy/paste:

```bash
npm run screenshot:approve -- \
  --all \
  --report=https://storage.googleapis.com/mdc-web-screenshot-tests/advorak/2018/07/14/03_37_19_142/report/report.json
```

**IMPORTANT:** Note the `--` between the script name and its arguments. This is required by `npm`.

This command will update your local `test/screenshot/golden.json` file with the newly captured screenshots.

### Rerunning a subset of tests

You can rerun a subset of the tests without running the entire suite, filtering by browser and/or URL.

On the
[report page](https://storage.googleapis.com/mdc-web-screenshot-tests/advorak/2018/07/14/03_37_19_142/report/report.html),
select the checkboxes for all screenshots you want to retry, and click the "Retry" button at the bottom of the page.

This will display a modal dialog containing a CLI command to copy/paste:

```bash
npm run screenshot:test -- \
  --url=mdc-button/classes/dense \
  --browser=ie@11
```

**IMPORTANT:** Note the `--` between the script name and its arguments. This is required by `npm`.

You can rerun multiple screenshots by passing an argument multiple times:

```bash
npm run screenshot:test -- \
  --url=mdc-button/classes/dense \
  --url=mdc-fab/classes/mini \
  --browser=ie@11 \
  --browser=chrome
```

These options are treated as regular expressions, so partial matches are possible. For example:

* `ie@11` matches `desktop_windows_ie@11`
* `chrome` matches `desktop_windows_chrome@latest` and `mobile_android_chrome@latest`

See `test/screenshot/browser.json` for the full list of supported browsers.

### Local dev server

The deprecated `npm run dev` command has been replaced by:

```bash
npm start
```

Open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser to view the test pages.

Source files are automatically recompiled when they change.

## Advanced usage

Use `--help` to see all available CLI options:

```bash
npm run screenshot:approve -- --help
npm run screenshot:build -- --help
npm run screenshot:demo -- --help
npm run screenshot:serve -- --help
npm run screenshot:test -- --help
```

**IMPORTANT:** Note the `--` between the script name and its arguments. This is required by `npm`.

### Public demos

```bash
npm run screenshot:demo
```

This will upload all test assets (HTML/CSS/JS files) to a public URL and print the URL to the terminal.

The URL can then be shared with designers or other developers.

### Excluding a subset of tests

You can exclude specific browsers and URLs by prefixing them with a `-`:

```bash
npm run screenshot:test -- \
  --url=-button \
  --browser=-edge
```

Positive and negative patterns can be mixed and matched:

```bash
npm run screenshot:test -- \
  --url=button,-mixins \
  --browser=desktop,-ie@11
```

**NOTE:** Negative patterns _always_ take precedence over positive patterns, regardless of the order they appear in the
command line.

### Diffing against other git branches and tags

By default, screenshots are diffed against your local `test/screenshot/golden.json` file.
This enables incremental diff reports, which are typically smaller and easier to review.

You can diff against a local/remote git branch, tag, or commit with the `--diff-base` flag:

```bash
npm run screenshot:test -- --diff-base=origin/master
npm run screenshot:test -- --diff-base=fix/fab/icon-alignment-ie11
npm run screenshot:test -- --diff-base=v0.37.0
npm run screenshot:test -- --diff-base=01abc11e0
```

URLs and file paths are also supported:

```bash
npm run screenshot:test -- --diff-base=/tmp/golden.json
npm run screenshot:test -- --diff-base=https://storage.googleapis.com/mdc-web-screenshot-tests/advorak/2018/07/12/05_07_59_278/golden.json
```

## Writing tests

**Goal**: Cover of every line of CSS generated by our Sass. This includes all CSS selectors.

### Guidelines

1.  Keep HTML files _small_ and _focused_. This makes it easier to review diffs.

2.  Each page should target a single logical "variant" of a component. For example:
    - One "block" CSS class (e.g., `mdc-button`)
    - One "modifier" CSS class (e.g., `mdc-button--dense`)
    - One Sass mixin (e.g., `mdc-button-ink-color`)

3.  File structure:

        /test/screenshot
            /mdc-foo
                /classes
                    - baseline.html
                    - dense.html
                    - ...
                /mixins
                    - custom.scss
                    - fill-color.html
                    - filled-accessible.html
                    - ink-color.html
                    - ...

4.  Do not test _combinations_ of mixins and modifier classes unless:
    1. It's necessary to prevent a regression; or
    2. We explicitly support the combination, and the implementation is likely to have bugs (e.g., `mdc-button--dense` and `mdc-button-outline-width` both set `line-height`)
