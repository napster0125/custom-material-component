# Sushi

A starting point for multi-device development.

### Overview

Sushi is a starter kit for multi-screen web development, encompassing opinionated recommendations on boilerplate and tooling for building an experience that works great across multiple devices.

The project aims to align with the mobile web recommendations made by Google's Web Central team and will include UX pattern samples and best practices that fall in line with some opinions we have about how multi-screen webapps should be built.

### What performance requirements does Sushi have?

Sushi will be striving to ship with a 60fps experience and 100% PageSpeed score out of the box. 

We intend to give developers a high performance starting point for multi-device development, paying close attention to this requirement when deciding on the libraries and tools we prescribe. We will be employing use of PageSpeed Insights and the Chromium Telemetry tools for helping us stay on top of this.

### Contains:

* Customized Mobile HTML5 Boilerplate
